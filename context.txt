Title: **Daily Grind Tracker for GATE and DSA**

Purpose:
The project is built to help students preparing for GATE and practicing DSA to track their daily study discipline. The goal is to mark daily progress for two key areas: **GATE preparation** and **DSA practice**, and calculate a daily score based on task completion.

Scope:
- Track only **GATE** and **DSA** daily status.
- Record the study status ('Done' or 'Skipped') for each.
- Store daily entries in a cloud database (Supabase) for easy access and future analysis.
- Calculate and store a simple **daily score** (0 to 2) based on the tasks done.

Features:
- Simple frontend using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
- Backend server built with Node.js and Express.js.
- Supabase as the backend database to store data.
- Scoring System:
  - "Done" = +1 point
  - "Skipped" = 0 point
- Display a success/failure message on submitting the day's report.

Database Structure:
- Table Name: `daily_logs`
- Columns:
  - `id` (auto increment)
  - `date` (Date)
  - `gate_status` (Text: 'green' or 'red')
  - `dsa_status` (Text: 'green' or 'red')
  - `score` (Integer between 0 and 2)

Why This Matters:
- Creates accountability and discipline in a long preparation journey.
- Shows patterns over time (e.g., lazy days, high performance weeks).
- Acts as a self-motivation booster by seeing the consistency visually later.

Future Possible Extensions:
- Add "view past entries" page.
- Add visual graphs to track weekly/monthly progress.
- Add login/authentication for privacy.
- Add leaderboard to compete with friends if needed later.

This project focuses ONLY on GATE and DSA, ensuring students stay consistent with two of the most critical pillars for career and academic success.
